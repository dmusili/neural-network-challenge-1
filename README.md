This is a project that because be used by a company that specializes in student loan refinancing. The main idea is to create a model that is used to predict student loan repayment so that the company can provide a more accurate interest rate for the borrower. 

In order to develop this model, we have been provided with the a CSV file that contains information about previous student loan recipients. We will use the features in the provided data set to create a model that will predict the likelihood that an applicant will repay their student loans. The CSV file contains information about these students, such as their credit ranking.

This project is written in Python. It can be run on on either Visual Studio Code, Jupyter or Collab.
